This measure, together with PendingCount, helps you know if analyses are stacking and taking too long to start processing. This helps you evaluate if it might be worth configuring additional Compute Engine workers (Enterprise Edition) or additional nodes (Data Center Edition) to improve SonarQube performance.",0,sonarqube,
sonarqube.compute_engine_tasks.processing_time,gauge,,,,"Measure the time (in ms) spent to process Background Tasks since the last restart of SonarQube. Its value will always increase and will be reset by a restart of SonarQube. This measure is very powerful when combined with SuccessCount and ErrorCount measures to get the average time to handle a Background Task, or when used to understand how much time the SonarQube Server is spending during a day to handle Background Tasks. It gives you an indication of the load on your server.",0,sonarqube,
